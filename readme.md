##cubelounge
A community site for cube-engine based games.

###yet another cube-community? Whyever?
Over time cube has extremely distributed itself and nowadays it is difficult to find all of those breadcrumbs.
cubelounge aims to be a plattform to unify existing communities. It is not intended to work as a replacement in any means. Moreover it is a central spot to find all informations related to cube-engine based games.

###that sounds interesting. Anyhow, what does it do?
cubelounge itself is composed by 4 main components, which are listed below:

- [newspaper](#news)
- [market](#market)
- [matchmaking](#matchmaking)
- [ranking](#ranking)

####news
The news page serves as an index of all articles related to cube, such as blog posts, forum entries (...)
You may add your own website using either [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [ATOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) feed format. After administrative approval entries from your site will be indexed as well.

####market
The _market_ is a special place to share your ideas, thoughts and stuff to everyone else. It is a global dashboard which allows you to upload maps, screenshots (..) as well as to comment on all activites by referincing them with a _#hashtag_.

####matchmaking
A classical matchmaking feature implemented as a [lobby-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking_%28video_games%29#Lobbies) system. Players may sign up for a game lobby and once the room is ready to go all participants are notified. Furthermore the best available server _(supporting matchmaking, is currently unused, optimal ping)_ is suggested.

####ranking
A ranking system that leans towards CSS:GO's ranking. You can sign up for a ranked game and their results will be stored. Similliar to a [ELO-ladder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) based system there are _"ranked-only"_ lobbies to maintain a thrilling expierence for all players.

###Alright. This is quiet nice, can I help you?
Yes you can! I am looking for any kind of help such as design improvements, bug fixes or ideas.
However I only value _usefull_ contributions, which is why you should read the [contribution guidelines](../blob/CONTRIBUTING.md) beforehand. Keep in mind that cubelounge is still early alpha software. A lot can change, and a lot hasn't been implemented yet.
